           <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
       </div>
       <div class="question">
           <h3>Q. My child	really wants to	act	on the stage/sing in front of an audience/be a star 24/7, but she doesn’t have any real experience or training.	Are	your programs appropriate for them?</h3>
       </div>
       <div class="answer">
           <h3>A. Absolutely. We have one top performing class,	our	Showcase Cast, which utilizes an audition-only casting process each semester. Other	than that, all our programs	are	designed to	bring out the confident	performer in each child, regardless	of experience or current ability level.	We are continually adjusting and re-structuring	our classes	to address the needs of	the students and are dedicated to focusing on the individual development of	each child first and foremost.</h3>
       </div>
       <div class="question">
           <h3>Q. Where	will my	child’s	shows be performed at the end of the semester?</h3>
       </div>
       <div class="answer">
           <h3>A. At	our	studio,	the	same	place	we	hold	classes	every	week.	We	have	a	125	person	audience	capacity	theater	fully	equipped with	wireless	body	mics, sound	system,	stage	lighting,	and	an	endless	inventory	of costumes,	props,	and	sets	on	hand	right	there	in	our	5400sq.	ft.	warehouse.	The	students	practice	every	week	on	the	same	stage	they	perform	on	and	we	are	able	to	keep	production	costs	down	by	providing	our	own	venue.</h3>
       </div>
       <div class="question">
           <h3>Q. I’m	concerned	that	my	child	will	just	be	sitting	around	in	class	doing	nothing	while	the	principle	 characters	are	rehearsing.	How	does	your	company	address	this	issue?</h3>
       </div>
       <div class="answer">
           <h3>A. Whenever	any	cast	is	rehearsing	for	a	show	there	is	always	going	to	be	times	when	some	cast	members	are	not	required	to	be	on	stage.	That	is	the	nature	of	the	beast	but	it	can	be	frustrating	for	parents	and	students	alike.	This	issue	has	always	been	at	the	top	of	our	priority	list	in	developing	our	curriculum and	classroom	structure,	and	there	are	many	ways	we	are	continually	working	to	minimize	wasted	class	time:
           <br>
           <br>
           • Skill	building	activities	and	theatre	games	are	utilized	each	week	in	addition	to	show	rehearsing.
           <br>
           <br>
           • Having	at	least	two	instructors	in	each	theatre	class enables	multiple	groups	to	rehearse	at	the	same time,	making	use	of	our	dance	room	and	vocal	rooms	when	available	in	addition	to	the	theater	itself.
           <br>
           <br>
           • Smaller	classes,	more	responsibility.	Once	we	have	the	minimum	cast	requirements	we	close	that	 class	and	label	it	FULL. Whenever	possible	we	will	give	a	student	two	smaller	roles	before	adding	another	student	to	the	class.	When	an	ensemble	group	is	needed,	we	try	to	offer	a	separate	group	specifically	for	students	who	would	like	to	be more involved	with	singing	and	dancing. Often	we	have them	perform	with	multiple	casts	as	an	added	incentive to	going	the	ensemble	route.
           <br>
           <br>
           • Memorizing	lines	and	lyrics,	practicing	scenes	with	a	partner	or	in	small	groups,	and	writing	down	stage	directions	and	performance	details	in	their	scripts	are	all	important	activities	we	encourage	students	to	initiate on	their	own when	not	on	stage.	
           <br>
           <br>
           •  Whenever	possible,	students	are	given	the	opportunity	to	help	with	set	and/or	costume	projectsduring	down	time	in	class.	If	they	are	offered,	encourage	your	child	to	participate.	Creating	a	sense	of	ownership	in	a	production	builds	respect	for	all	aspects	of	the	theatre	and	may	lead	to	untapped	interests.
           <br>
           <br>
           Our	emphasis,	especially	with	the	older	kids, is	on	personal	responsibility	regarding	time	management. Ultimately,	it	is	the	student’s	choice	whether	they	take	advantage	of	the	opportunities	presented	them	each week	they	come	to	class.	We	strive	to	create	an	actual	learning	environment	and	those	students	we	have seen	 make	the	most	progress	in	their	performance	abilities	are	the	ones	who	pay	attention	to	what	is	occurring	on	stage,	even	if	they	are	sitting	in	the	audience.	There	is	a	wealth	of	information,	great	advice,	and	universal	performing	concepts	being	disseminated	each week	in	class.	All	of	it	is	applicable	to	each	and	every	student.
